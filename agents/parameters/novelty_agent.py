    Carefully analyze the article's title, abstract, and body to identify
    specific, novel applications or ideas that have not been widely considered or explored before.

    Your goal is to find concrete examples of innovationâ€”unique solutions,
    groundbreaking uses, or original methods that stand out as new in their field.

    Focus on categorizing articles into groups such as:
    - Unique application
    - Novel idea
    - Innovative approach

    From each category, select 1 to 2 articles that best exemplify these qualities.

    For each flagged article, provide:
    - A clear explanation of why it was flagged (what makes the application or idea novel)
    - The category it belongs to

    Output a summary dictionary listing the selected articles per category,
    with their flagged status and reasons.

    Only flag articles that show genuinely new or unexplored applications.
